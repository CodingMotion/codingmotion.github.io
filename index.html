        <h1>Coding Motion DC </h1>

        <p class="power-pitch">Coding Motion is a small group for anyone interested in pushing the limits of animation through code. We take inspiration from everyday things and come together to build interactives. All you need is an interest in the topic and some intermediate <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JS</strong> skills.</p>

         <h3>Why?</h3>

         <p>We aim to make the web a little less static by building interactions that are often seen in user interfaces.</p>

         <h3>Who?</h3>

         <p>These workshops are geared towards those with an intermediary understanding of CSS & JS. If you like bringing designs to life with engaging interactions that enhance the user experience, then this group is for you.</p>
